Hello {{ user.first_name|safe }},

This is a friendly reminder that you haven't updated the remaining hours on the
tasks you have assigned in the last {{ remind_days }} day{{ remind_days|pluralize }}.

You're probably on vacation, or were working on something else, but if not,
please make sure to update your hours.  Just to let you know, I'll keep bugging
you periodically until you do because I want to make sure that I have the best
data to share with your team.

For your convenience, I've provided the list of the tasks you've told me you're
working on below.  If you're working on a task that I don't mention, kindly let
me know on my website.

    Your Tasks for {{ sprint }}:
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------
{% for c in task_snapshot_cache %}
      * #{{ c.task_snapshot.task.remote_tracker_id }}: {{ c.task_snapshot.title|safe }}
        {{ c.task_snapshot.task.get_absolute_url }}
{% endfor %}
Thanks in advance!

Your pal,
